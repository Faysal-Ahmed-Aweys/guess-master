# **Guess Master**

Guess master is a game where the player tries to guess the number that the computer is thinking of in 3 tries.
The computer tells them the range and if they guess a number higher than the number that computer is thinking of, the computer tells them to go lower and if they guess a lower number, the computer tells them to go higher.
If they guess the number before the tries finish, they win otherwise they lose.
